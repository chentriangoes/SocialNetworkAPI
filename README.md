## üìã Description
This project is to create a back end system of Social Network API though NoSQL, in support of users to create their thoughts and connection between each other. A mongodb database is created through mongoose with three schemas: user, thought, and reaction being created to store inputs. Information, such as the username, user's thoughts, reactions to user's thoughts, friends of associated users, and so on are able to get looked up (GET), created (POST), updated (PUSH), and deleted (DELETE) through the routes. All routes were passed tests in Insomnia for above information to be successfully changes accordingly.
